# Esp32-S3-camera

JLCPCB is a company that constructs PCBs and prints 3D mechanical designs, they give us great offers with cheap prices for high quality precision PCBs. I would like to thank JLCPCB for their sponsorship and for supporting me in creating and innovating schematics, and improving my PCBs designs.

Artificial intelligence now is a tendency of our cycle. Most electronics companies work on chips or microcontrollers have AI calculators with minimum specification and more performance.
After the big success that the ESP32-S3 got, it's time for the new revolution ESP32-S3 Camera.
This pcb is designed for AI uses,it could be divided into différents parts.
First, The Microcontroller ESP32-S3 has an Artificial internet of things calculator (AIOT),So it helps us to implement Ai and IOT in this chip.
Then,it contains USB for OTG and FTDI pins for UART communication ( uploading code and Serial monitor).
The camera support makes the big difference with the latest ESP32-S3, it’s the support of ESP32-S3 eye.
Finally, we use regulators to adapt our voltage with the power supply of the circuit.
